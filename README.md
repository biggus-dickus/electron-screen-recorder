# Electron Screen Recorder

Dead simple screen recording app written with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [MediaStream Recording API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API).

1. Choose the video source (window or screen) to record.
2. Press "Start recording".
3. When done, press "Stop recording", and you'll be prompted with a file save dialogue.

No sound is recorded (because in space no-one can hear you scream).
